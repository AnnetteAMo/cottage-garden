        <p>Cottage gardens are always associated with roses: shrub roses, climbing roses, and old garden roses with lush foliage,
            in contrast to the gangly modern hybrid tea roses. Old cottage garden roses include cultivated forms of Rosa
            gallica, which form dense mounded shrubs 3–4 <abbr aria-label="feet">ft</abbr> high and wide, with pale pink
            to purple flowers—with single form to full double form blooms. They are also very fragrant, and include the ancient
            Apothecary's rose (<i>R. gallica
            'Officinalis'</i>), whose magenta flowers were preserved solely for their fragrance. Another old fragrant cottage
            garden rose is the Damask rose, which is still grown in Europe for use in perfumes. Cultivated forms of this
            grow 4 to 6 <abbr aria-label="feet">ft</abbr> or higher, with gently arching canes that help give an informal
            look to a garden. Even taller generally are the Alba roses, which are not always white, and which bloom well
            even in partial shade.</p>
