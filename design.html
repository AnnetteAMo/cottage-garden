        <p>The cottage garden design is based more on principles than formulae: it has an informal look, with a seemingly casual
            mixture of flowers, herbs, and vegetables often packed into a small area. In spite of their appearances, cottage
            gardens have a design and formality that help give them their grace and charm. Due to space limitations, they
            are often in small rectangular plots, with practical functioning paths and hedges or fences. The plants, layout,
            and materials are chosen to give the impression of casualness and a country feel. Modern cottage gardens frequently
            use local flowers and materials, rather than those of the traditional cottage garden. What they share with the
            tradition is the unstudied look, the use of every square inch, and a rich variety of flowers, herbs, and vegetables.</p>

        <p>The cottage garden is designed to appear artless, rather than contrived or pretentious. Instead of artistic curves,
            or grand geometry, there is an artfully designed irregularity. Borders can go right up to the house, lawns are
            replaced with tufts of grass or flowers, and beds can be as wide as needed. Instead of the discipline of large
            scale color schemes, there is the simplicity of harmonious color combinations between neighbouring plants. The
            overall appearance can be of "a vegetable garden that has been taken over by flowers." The method of planting
            closely packed plants was supposed to reduce the amount of weeding and watering required, but planted stone pathways
            or turf paths, and clipped hedges overgrown with wayward vines, are cottage garden features requiring well-timed
            maintenance.

        <p>Paths, arbors, and fences use traditional or antique looking materials. Wooden fences and gates, paths covered with
            locally made bricks or stone, and arbors using natural materials all give a more casual—and less formal—look
            and feel to a cottage garden. Pots, ornaments, and furniture also use natural looking materials with traditional
            finishes—everything is chosen to give the impression of an old-fashioned country garden.</p>
