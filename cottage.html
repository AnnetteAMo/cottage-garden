        <p>The <strong>cottage garden</strong> is a distinct style that uses informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings,
            and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. English in origin, it depends on grace and charm rather than grandeur
            and formal structure. Homely and functional gardens connected to working-class cottages go back centuries, but
            their stylized reinvention occurred in 1870s England, as a reaction to the more structured, rigorously maintained
            estate gardens with their formal designs and mass plantings of greenhouse annuals. </p>

        <p>The <strong>earliest cottage gardens</strong> were more practical than today's, with emphasis on vegetables and herbs,
            fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant.
            The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early
            cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as <em>primroses</em> and <em>violets</em>, along
            with flowers with household use such as <em>calendula</em> and various herbs. Others were the richly scented
            old-fashioned <em>roses</em> that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like <em>daisies</em>. In time, cottage-garden
            sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.</p>

        <p><strong>Modern cottage gardens</strong> include countless regional and personal variations and embrace plant materials,
            such as ornamental grasses or native plants not seen in the rural gardens of cottagers. Traditional roses, with
            their full fragrance and lush foliage, continue to be a cottage-garden mainstay — along with modern disease-resistant
            varieties that retain traditional attributes. Informal climbing plants, whether traditional or modern hybrids,
            are also common, as are the self-sowing annuals and freely spreading perennials favoured in traditional cottagers'
            gardens.
